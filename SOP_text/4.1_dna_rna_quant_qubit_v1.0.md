## Purpose/Scope: ##
This procedure describes the steps required to perform quantification of RNA/DNA or cDNA using the Invitrogen (Thermo Fisher Scientific) fluorimeter – Qubit and the Qubit kits. Flourimetric methods are advantageous over spectrophotometric methods since they are more precise and specific to the molecule being measured.

## Equipment and consumable: ##
1.	Qubit Assay optical tubes (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat#Q32856)
2.	DNA LoBind Microcentrifuge Tubes1.5mL (Thermo Scientific, Cat#13-698-791)
3.	Kimwipes (Fisher Scientific, Cat#06-666 or similar) 

## Reagents: ##
1.	One of the following Qubit assays:  
  a.	Qubit RNA BR Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Cat#Q10210/Q10211)  
  b.	Qubit RNA HS Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher CatQ32852/Q32855)  
  c.	Qubit dsDNA BR Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher CatQ32850/Q32853)  
  d.	Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Cat#Q32851/Q32854)  
  e.	Qubit miRNA Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Cat#Q32880/Q32881)  
  f.	Qubit 1X dsDNA HS Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Cat#Q33231/30 – preferred for cDNA library quantification)  
* All kits listed come with the appropriate standards. 
* Choose a kit based on the type of extract is being quantified and the Quantifiable Range of the kits presented in **Figure 1**.
