## General Instructions: ##
1.	Recommended input amount of DNA is 500nG for large genome organisms(murine) and 200-300ng for small genome organisms (microbial). 
2.	The tagmentation protocol won’t normalize final library yield for samples prepped from < 100nG of DNA.
3.	Make sure to record the sample information with the Index ID that will be added to each sample. 
4.	Always seal plates with adhesive seal before vortexing, spinning or PCR steps.
5.	Only stop during safe stopping points of the procedure.
6.	If not using the whole kit, label the used tubes on top of the lid with the abbreviation of the consumable name. 
7.	If preparing >8 libraries use a multichannel to dispense reagents to save time:  
  a.	Aliquot the reagent into 8-tube strip or a reagent plate.  
  b.	Transfer reagent from strip/reagent plate on to the reaction plate.  
  c.	Dispose of the 8-tube strips when done. If using a reagent plate, cross out the used reagent title.

4.	Vortex the tagmentation master mix
5.	Using multi-channel, transfer 20uL of the master mix into each well of the plate containing the samples. Change tips between each column. 
6.	Mix the sample with the master mix by pipetting each row 10 times or by vortexing the plate for 1min at 1800 RPM. 
7.	Seal the plate and place on the thermal cycler. Run TAG program. 

*Step 2: Post tagmentation cleanup*
### Consumables ###  
•	Tagment Stop Buffer (**TSB**)  
•	Tagment Wash Buffer (**TWB**)  

### Preparation ###
1.	Prepare the following consumables:  
  a.	TSB – stored at RT. If precipitates observed, heat at 37°C for 10min and then vortex until dissolved.  Use at room temperature.  
  b.	TWB – Stored at RT. Foaming easily. 

### Procedure ###
1.	Add 10uL TSB to the tagmentation reaction using a multichannel pipette. 
2.	Pipette each well 10 times to mix, alternatively, mix by vortexing for 20sec at 1800 RPM. 
3.	Seal plate and place on the thermal cycler. Run the PTC program. 
4.	Take plate out of the thermal cycler and let stand at RT for 1min. 
5.	Place the plate on the magnetic stand and wait 3-5min until the liquid is clear.
6.	Using a multichannel pipette, remove and discard supernatant. Avoid touching the bead pellet. 
7.	Wash twice as following:  
  a.	Remove plate from magnetic stand. Very slowly add 100uL of TWB to avoid foaming.  
  b.	Pipette slowly until the beads are fully resuspended.  
  c.	Place the plate on the magnetic stand and wait 3-5min until the liquid is clear.
