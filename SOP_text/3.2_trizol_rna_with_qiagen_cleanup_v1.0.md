## Purpose/Scope: ##
This procedure describes the steps required to extract RNA from mammalian tissue using the TRIzol reagent for isolation and Qiagen Allprep mini kit for clean-up. In addition, in this procedure we describe steps for depleting the isolated RNA from DNA using QIAgen RNase-Free DNase set. This step is required for RNA that will be used for sequencing. 
It is strongly advised to read the AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini-Handbook in full. 

**_Some buffers in this kit contain guanidine salt and are not compatible with disinfectants containing bleach._**

This protocol is used mainly for RNA isolation from the following tissues: 
-	Skin   
  Starting material: 20-50mG   
  Expected yield: 0.5uG of RNA/mG of tissue. (+/-0.3)  
-	Muscles (Quadriceps, Tibialis anterior, Gastrocnemius)  
  Starting material: TA 20-30mG, Quad 50mG, GST 30-50mG  
  Expected yield: TA 0.28uG of RNA/mG of tissue, Quad 0.1uG of RNA/mG of tissue, Gastrocnemius 0.15uG of RNA/mG of tissue

## Procedure: ##
	Initial prep:  
* Pre-chill microcentrifuge to 4°C.
* Make sure 100% EtOH is added to all the QIAGEN concentrated buffers RPE and RW1
* Set a microcentrifuge to room temperature (25°C).
* Prepare a working rack with pre labeled tubes as illustrated in below:
