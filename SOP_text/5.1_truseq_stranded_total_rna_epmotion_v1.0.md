#### General Instructions: ####
The workflow is separated into five distinct segments: 001) cDNA Synthesis, 002) cDNA Cleanup, 003) Library Prep, 004) Post-PCR Cleanup, 005) Aliquot libraries for QC.

*General practices and notes*:

1.	Whenever prompted by the software, always click “Use minimal volume”. Leave all other settings in their default mode.
2.	To avoid any collision, ensure that any labware left on the desk is represented in the software.
3.	During User Interventions, do not click “OK” until you have returned the plate to the correct position.
4.	Empty waste before starting any run on EpMotion.
5.	When prompted to refill tips, always use a full box of tips.
6.	Record lot number of each reagents on the metadata sheet attached.
7.	To avoid cross contamination, remove unused reagents and index tubes from the working area. 
8.	Seal the 96 well plate before each PCR steps. Roll the adhesive seal with rubber roller after application. 
9.	Warm up the applicable reagents to room temp as described in the protocol. 
10.	Do not freeze beads. Store at 4°C when not in use.
11.	Use Appendix A: Metadata sheet to record samples used as well as reagent lot#.
