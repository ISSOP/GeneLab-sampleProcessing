## Purpose/Scope: ##
This procedure describes the steps required to perform automated electrophoresis of RNA samples. This procedure is using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer System and Agilent RNA 6000 Nano and Pico kits. This procedure will generate a gel image of the RNA as well as RIN and DV200 values, those are recorded and used to track sample quality.

## Equipment and consumables: ##

1.	Chip priming station (Agilent cat#5065-4401) 
2.	KIA vortex mixer 
3.	DNA LoBind Microcentrifuge Tubes1.5mL (Thermo Scientific, Cat#13-698-791)
4.	2100 Bioanalyzer system (Agilent, Cat#G2939BA) 
5.	Table top vortex(VWR, Cat#102091-234 or similar)
6.	Bench top microcentrifuge to accommodate 1.5mL tubes (Thermo Scientific Cat#75004081 or similar)

## Reagents: ##
1.	One of the following kits*:  
  a. Agilent RNA 6000 Nano Kit (Agilent, cat#5067-1511) 
Number of samples/chip: 12, qualitative range: 5-500nG/uL 
  b. Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent cat#5067-1513)  
Number of samples/chip: 11, qualitative range: 50-5000 pG/uL (0.05-5nG/uL) 

*Choose a kit base on the quantitative range of the kits.  

2.	RNase/DNase free water (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat#10977023) 
3.	RNaseZap RNase Decontamination Solution (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat# AM9780 or similar) 

## Procedure: ##
1.	Take the RNA 6000 kit (without the ladder! Ladder handling described in detail in Reagent Prep section 3 of this SOP) out of storage and let it equilibrate to RT for a minimum of 30min prior use.
  a. Always insert the pipette tip to the bottom of the well when dispensing the liquid.
