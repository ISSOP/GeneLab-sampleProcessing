## Purpose/Scope: ##
The procedure below describes the steps required to homogenize biological sample using the hand held rotor stator homogenizer Polytron. This type of homogenator allow for a larger lysis buffer volume and is used mainly for samples that require larger yield and/or not yet optimized for bead homogenization. This procedure is currently routinely used for mouse skin RNA extraction that requires a downstream Trizol extraction (SOP#3.2). 

## Equipment and consumables: ##
1.	Eppendorf Centrifuge 5810/5180 R
2.	Polytron Rotor Stator Homogenizer (Kinematica PT 1300 D)

3.	Styrofoam box and dissection tools (forceps, scalpel, scissors) 
4.	Kimwipes (Fisher Scientific, Cat#06-666 or similar)
