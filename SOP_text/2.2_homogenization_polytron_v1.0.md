## Purpose/Scope: ##
The procedure below describes the steps required to homogenize biological sample using the hand held rotor stator homogenizer Polytron. This type of homogenator allow for a larger lysis buffer volume and is used mainly for samples that require larger yield and/or not yet optimized for bead homogenization. This procedure is currently routinely used for mouse skin RNA extraction that requires a downstream Trizol extraction (SOP#3.2). 

## Equipment and consumables: ##
1.	Eppendorf Centrifuge 5810/5180 R
2.	Polytron Rotor Stator Homogenizer (Kinematica PT 1300 D)

3.	Styrofoam box and dissection tools (forceps, scalpel, scissors) 
4.	Kimwipes (Fisher Scientific, Cat#06-666 or similar) 

## Reagents: ##
1.	Select a lysis buffer depending on the downstream extraction protocol used:
* If following SOP #3.1, on the day of tissue cutting/extraction prepare 800-800uL of QIAGEN buffer RLT + 1% b-ME per sample
* If following SOP #3.2 on the day of tissue cutting/extraction prepare 600-800uL of TRIzol solution per sample
* If following SOP #3.3 on the day of the tissue cutting/extraction prepare 1000uL of CTAB buffer per sample
2.	Freshly made 70% EtOH, using molecular grade 200 proof EtOH and RNase/DNase free water 
3.	RNaseZap RNase decontamination solution (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat#AM9780 or Cat#AM9782 or Cat#AM9784 or similar) 
4.	MilliQ water 

## Procedure: ##
1.	Pre-chill a centrifuge that can fit 10mL round bottom tubes to 4Â°C (suggested Eppendorf Centrifuge 5810/5180 R). 
1.	For each sample prepare 15mL conical tubes with:   
  a.	10mL clean water  
  b.	10mL 70% EtOH  
2.	Prepare general wash solutions in 50ml conical tubes: (prepare a set for each 6 samples processed)  
  a.	40mL clean water  
  b.	40mL 70% EtOH  

### Preparing Polytron ###
3.	Assemble the dispersing aggregate and connect to the drive unit.
