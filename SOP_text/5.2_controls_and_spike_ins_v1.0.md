## Purpose/Scope: ##
As described in detail on GeneLab.nasa.gov webpage titled “GeneLab Sequencing Standards and Services” we encourage the researchers to use two levels of control in the Total RNA sequencing workflow. This SOP describes the suggested protocol. 

## Reagents: ##
1.	Universal Mouse Reference RNA (Agilent, Cat#740100)
2.	Universal Human Reference RNA (Agilent, Cat#740000) 
3.	ERCC ExFold RNA Spike-In Mixes (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat#4456739) 
4.	UltraPure DNase/RNase-free Distilled Water (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat#10977023 OR similar) 

## ERCC Spike-In use ##
1.	For long term storage, keep unopen, non aliquoted ERCC kits in -80C storage.
2.	ERCC Spike In reagent prep:  
  a.	On the day of the experiment, thaw one kit (ERCC Spike-In Mix 1 and ERCC Spike-In Mix 2) on ice .  
  b.	Make ten 1uL aliquots of ERCC Spike-In Mix 1.  
  c.	Make ten 1uL aliquots of ERCC Spike-In Mix 2.  
  d.	Store aliquots in -20C until use .  
3.	Retrieve one tube of Mix 1 and one tube of Mix 2.
4.	Dilute each mix 1:100 by adding 99uL of DNase/RNase-free distilled water into the ERCC mix tube, briefly vortex and spin down the tube. 
5.	Keep 1:100 ERCC Spike In mixes on ice until use.
6.	On the day of the library preparation follow one of the following options:  
  a.	Normalize an RNA aliquot to 1.5ug of RNA in 17uL of RNase/DNase free water.  
  b.	If working with Pre-normalized RNA aliquots, take it out of the storage and fully thaw before adding the ERCC mixes.     Quantify RNA using Qubit BR RNA reagent to make sure the concentration range is acceptable.  

**Note**: Follow the ERCC RNA Spike-In User Guide if using a different RNA concentration/Spike in dilution.
